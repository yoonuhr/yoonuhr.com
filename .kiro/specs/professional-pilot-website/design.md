# Design Document

## Overview

The professional pilot website will transform the existing terminal-board design into a comprehensive aviation portfolio while maintaining the unique flip-board aesthetic that sets it apart from typical professional websites. The design will feel like stepping into a modern flight operations center, with the terminal board serving as the hero section and the aesthetic extending throughout all sections.

## Architecture

### Single-Page Application Structure
- **Layout**: Vertical scrolling single-page application with distinct sections
- **Navigation**: Fixed aviation-themed navigation bar resembling aircraft instrument panel
- **Sections**: Hero (terminal board), About, Experience, Certifications, Career, Contact
- **Transitions**: Smooth scrolling between sections with subtle parallax effects

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (maintaining current simplicity)
- **Animations**: CSS3 transitions and keyframe animations for flip effects
- **Responsive**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages (static site optimization)

```

## Data Models

### Professional Information Structure
```javascript
const pilotProfile = {
  personal: {
    name: "string",
    title: "string",
    location: "string",
    contact: {
      email: "string",
      phone: "string",
      linkedin: "string"
    }
  },
  experience: {
    totalHours: "number",
    aircraftTypes: ["string"],
    routes: ["string"],
    specializations: ["string"]
  },
  certifications: {
    licenses: [{
      type: "string",
      number: "string",
      expiration: "date"
    }],
    ratings: ["string"],
    medical: {
      class: "string",
      expiration: "date"
    }
  },
  career: [{
    company: "string",
    position: "string",
    startDate: "date",
    endDate: "date",
    achievements: ["string"]
  }]
}
```

### Animation Configuration
```javascript
const animationConfig = {
  flipDuration: 300,
  flipDelay: 100,
  scrollTransition: 800,
  parallaxSpeed: 0.5,
  typewriterSpeed: 50
}
```

## Visual Design System

### Color Palette
```css
:root {
  --primary-bg: #1a1a1a;
  --secondary-bg: #000;
  --accent-yellow: #ffc600;
  --text-primary: #f0f0f0;
  --text-secondary: #aaa;
  --border-color: #333;
  --success-green: #00ff00;
  --warning-amber: #ffbf00;
  --danger-red: #ff0000;
}
```

### Typography
```css
/* Primary: Monospace for terminal aesthetic */
font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;

/* Hierarchy */
h1: 2.5em, letter-spacing: 4px
h2: 2em, letter-spacing: 3px
h3: 1.5em, letter-spacing: 2px
body: 1em, letter-spacing: 1px
```

### Layout Grid
```css
/* Desktop: 12-column grid */
.container { max-width: 1200px; margin: 0 auto; }

/* Tablet: 8-column grid */
@media (max-width: 768px) { /* responsive adjustments */ }

/* Mobile: Single column */
@media (max-width: 480px) { /* mobile optimizations */ }
```

## Responsive Design Strategy

### Breakpoints
- **Desktop**: 1200px+ (Full terminal board experience)
- **Tablet**: 768px-1199px (Condensed terminal layout)
- **Mobile**: 320px-767px (Stacked sections, simplified animations)

### Mobile Adaptations
- Terminal board becomes vertically stacked
- Flip animations reduced for performance
- Touch-friendly navigation
- Simplified parallax effects
- Optimized font sizes and spacing

## Error Handling

### Animation Fallbacks
```javascript
// Detect reduced motion preference
if (window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches) {
  // Disable flip animations, use fade transitions
}

// Browser compatibility checks
if (!CSS.supports('transform', 'rotateX(90deg)')) {
  // Fallback to simple text changes
}
```

### Performance Monitoring
```javascript
// Monitor animation performance
const observer = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  // Adjust animation complexity based on performance
});
```

## Testing Strategy

### Cross-Browser Testing
- **Chrome/Edge**: Primary development target
- **Firefox**: Animation compatibility testing
- **Safari**: iOS/macOS specific testing
- **Mobile browsers**: Touch interaction testing

### Performance Testing
- **Lighthouse audits**: Target 90+ performance score
- **Animation frame rate**: Maintain 60fps during animations
- **Load time**: Under 3 seconds on 3G connection
- **Bundle size**: Optimize images and minimize CSS/JS

### Accessibility Testing
- **Screen readers**: Ensure flip animations don't interfere
- **Keyboard navigation**: Full site navigable via keyboard
- **Color contrast**: WCAG AA compliance
- **Motion sensitivity**: Respect prefers-reduced-motion

### User Experience Testing
- **Navigation flow**: Intuitive section transitions
- **Content hierarchy**: Clear information architecture
- **Mobile usability**: Touch-friendly interactions
- **Loading states**: Smooth progressive enhancement
